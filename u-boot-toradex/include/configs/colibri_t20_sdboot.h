/*
SD-BOOT
The sd sector numbers are used as follows:
u-boot needs to find ENV and LNX to get to the environment and the kernel, the kernel needs to find the APP partition for the rootfs.
ENV: colibri_t20_sdboot.h
Set CONFIG_ENV_MMC_OFFSET to the byte start address of ENV, take the sector address of Partid 6 (which is in 2048 byte sectors)

LNX: colibri_t20.h
Set the u-boot environment SDBOOTCMD below, mmc read RAMloadaddr, 512byte sector start, 512byte copy length.
Take the sector address of Partid 7 (which is in 2048 byte sectors).

APP: colibri_t20.h
Set the u-boot environment sdargs and the variable GPT_PRIMARY_PARTITION_TABLE_LBA below.
The kernel finds the partition with the help of the GP1/GPT partitions. The kernel commandline must include "gpt gpt_sector=xxx"
to force it to use GUID Partition Table (GPT) and to give the 512byte sector start address of the primary GUID.
Take the start address of Partid 8 (which is in 2048 byte sectors). add 1 to the resulting 512byte block. (at pos. 0 is the MBR)

E.g. Output during nvflash procedure on serial console:
SD Alloc Partid=2, start sector=0,num=1536
SD Alloc Partid=3, start sector=1536,num=64
SD Alloc Partid=4, start sector=1600,num=960
SD Alloc Partid=5, start sector=2560,num=64
SD Alloc Partid=6, start sector=2624,num=64
SD Alloc Partid=7, start sector=2688,num=4096
SD Alloc Partid=8, start sector=6784,num=512
SD Alloc Partid=9, start sector=7296,num=3879808
SD Alloc Partid=11, start sector=3887104,num=0

sector start address 6784 * 2048 -> 27137 * 512 -> GPT start sector is 27137.
